# Sponsors Us

Opensource projects live and die with community support. To ensure TrueCharts can continue it's great effort to become the best resource for Helm Charts and TrueNAS SCALE Apps, we aim to become fully self-funding in the future.

## Project Sponsorship

A sponsor gets a more-or-less little reward for their investment into our project. In the future we're also planning to add unique actions and rewards for existing sponsors, on-top-off the already great rewards!

We currently offer multiple recurring sponsor tiers:
